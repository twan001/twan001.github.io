		<h1> <b>Freshman Negative Fifteen</b> </h1>
		<p>	   Instead of the freshman fifteen, I was cursed with the freshman negative fifteen. The reason why I slimmed down so remarkably was because of my naive decision to start a new life, three hundred miles away from home. The challenges of being independent was one of the most taxing challenges that I had ever encountered.<br>
		Throughout my life, family was always first on my list of priorities. On the weekends, instead of socializing with friends, I would dine out and shop with my parents. A week after my parents helped settle me into my cramped, musty dormitory, I came to the realization that I could not call the city of Riverside my new home. Without family or friends, I found myself constantly lonely and crying in my room. The nostalgic feelings of home left me heartbroken and unmotivated to eat or work. Eventually, I fell into the evils of depression and contemplated about withdrawing from school to escape my predicament.<br> 
		I never like losing without putting up a good fight. After a draining month, I finally had the courage to say that I could not depend on my parents anymore. There will be a time when I will have to move away from home. As my mentality matured, so did my goals in life. Riverside is a great school, but opportunities and courses are very limited. Therefore, I made it a goal to transfer universities to seek new, challenging, educational opportunities from a prestigious school and to be exposed to different cultures from various parts of California. Then, I could proudly say that I made the most out of my college journey.<br>
		My matured mentality did not settle in immediately. It took more than half of the year for me to adjust. As my health improved, so did my grades. I ended my first year of college with a 3.85 GPA, and I was placed on the Chancellorâ€™s list. I also became more involved in clubs related to my major such as, IEEE and ACM. Fortunately, I was able to find a new meaning in life and education.  <br> <i>*Excerpt taken from my own UC Application essay.* </i></br> </p>

		<h1> The PAD </h1>
		<p>	After my first year of college, I moved into an apartment with my three best friends. The apartment made Riverside feel more like home. Everyday when I walked to school, the walk reminded me of my walks to high school. Unlike the dorms, the apartment did not feel like a prison. The fact that my friends were less then a few feet away from my room was very comforting. During some nights, I would walk to my roommates Andrew's room and watch him dominate in a game of Fortnite or we would stream basketball games. <br> The worst part about living off campus was cooking. I like to eat healthy, so the food that I cooked was extremely bland. On Sunday nights, I would go grocery shopping and buy a weeks worth of groceries. Then, I would cook all the protein and vegetables that I bought, so that I would not have to worry about cooking a fresh meal every day. This saved me a lot of time, as I would only spend two hours cooking and have a weeks worth of meal. <br> When finals week was nearing, I would stop cooking completely. I would live off of frozen food, like hotpockets, or eat cereal and bagels. If I get tired of eating all that, I would just go out and grab take out. I have to admit, the dining halls were very clutch. I did not have to stress about what to eat or going hungry. <br> Living off of campus definitely changed my persepective of Riverside. I had much more freedom to do what I wanted without having my parents or resident advisors tell me what not to do. The experience of living in a dorm varies per person. For me, dorm life felt like a prison. I am always on campus and there would be nothing to do. Therefore, wait until you live off campus. I guranteed that it will be much more fun. <br> </p>

	<h1> Make the "Impossible" Possible </h1>
	<p> One of the goals that I set for myself, during the first two years of college, was to transfer to another school. Without much resources, I really had to do the research myself. It is a headache, but it is not as bad now that I look back at it. <br> If you simply google, [school name] transfer requirements, the first page should link you to what you are trying to find. Each school will either have the information easily accessible or you will just need to dig a little bit deeper. I suggest going on UC Irvine's website to find the requirements, because it made the process really clear. If you want an idea, I have included the link. <br> Once you have the list of requiremnts(classes), compare your course plan from your current school with the list of requirements from the other school. You need to take every course the college requires. Therefore, you need to plan very carefully each quarter, so that you meet all the requirements. Try and finish all your general education requirements along with all your lower division requirements, as UCs have something called UC Reciprocity. If you completed all your general education requirements, you do not need to take any more at your new college. It comes in handy, in terms of saving time and money.<br> If you are unsure about whether or not the class you are going taking covers one of the requiremnts, you should go to <a href=http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome.html target="_blank">assist.org</a> or email the other school's counselor. <br> Now that you have all the necessary information, the final step is to keep your grades up. Try not to fail any courses, and keep your GPA above a 3.5 preferably. When I transferred I had a 3.82. <br> Do not be discouraged if you still do not get into anywhere. When college acceptance came out, I only got into 1 out of the 4 schools that I applied for. Transferring from UCs to UCs is not impossible like some people would say, but it is quite difficult. It is all luck in my opinion. Just keep working hard academically and socially. Good luck everyone! I believe in you all. </p>

	<h1> Where I Am Now? </h1>
	<p> After spending two years at the University of California, Riverside, I have successfully transfered to the University of California, San Diego. One of my other goals for transfering was to be closer to home. Now I am closer to Mexico. <br>
	I have definitely learned from my experiences being a freshman, even though I am considered a transfer. I believe that the experience is roughly the same because freshmans and transfers both need to learn on how to adapt to a new environment, but I have it easier than most. <br>
	I can definitely see why UCSD is one of the top three UC's. The cirriculums are very helpful and applicable to practical use. I have been challenged by all my professors so far, and it is quite fun. <br>
	To be fair, I do not know if transferring was the correct decision. Coming to San Diego, I lost my second home, Riverside. After my second year of college, I was really looking forward to continuing my college career at Riverside. It is not that I am not adjusting well to San Diego, but the culture and the people is just different from Riverside. <br>
	I have also lost 10 pounds. So, I think its Transfer Negative Ten for me. Do not get me wrong, I am having a great time here. I constantly remind myself that missing my friends is temporary, just like how being in San Diego is. There will be a chance for all of us to reunite. Switching schools, I was considering about the long run. UCSD > UCR, when recruiters see different resumes. <br>
	If you are left in the same predicament as me, just think about what is more important. Your future or the present? Wherever you are, you will have equal opportunities of succeeding. To me UCSD = UCR, there is nothing special. Be wherever you are happy. Good luck friends!
