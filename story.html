		<h1> Story 1 </h1>
		<p>	Instead of the freshman fifteen, I was cursed with the freshman negative fifteen. The reason why I slimmed down so remarkably was because of my naive decision to start a new life, three hundred miles away from home. The challenges of being independent was one of the most taxing challenges that I had ever encountered.
		Throughout my life, family was always first on my list of priorities. On the weekends, instead of socializing with friends, I would dine out and shop with my parents. A week after my parents helped settle me into my cramped, musty dormitory, I came to the realization that I could not call the city of Riverside my new home. Without family or friends, I found myself constantly lonely and crying in my room. The nostalgic feelings of home left me heartbroken and unmotivated to eat or work. Eventually, I fell into the evils of depression and contemplated about withdrawing from school to escape my predicament. 
		I never like losing without putting up a good fight. After a draining month, I finally had the courage to say that I could not depend on my parents anymore. There will be a time when I will have to move away from home. As my mentality matured, so did my goals in life. Riverside is a great school, but opportunities and courses are very limited. Therefore, I made it a goal to transfer universities to seek new, challenging, educational opportunities from a prestigious school and to be exposed to different cultures from various parts of California. Then, I could proudly say that I made the most out of my college journey.
		My matured mentality did not settle in immediately. It took more than half of the year for me to adjust. As my health improved, so did my grades. I ended my first year of college with a 3.85 GPA, and I was placed on the Chancellorâ€™s list. I also became more involved in clubs related to my major such as, IEEE and ACM. Fortunately, I was able to find a new meaning in life and education. </p>

		<h1> Story2 </h1>
		<p>	After my first year of college, I moved into an apartment with my three best friends. The apartment made Riverside feel more like home. Everyday when I walked to school, the walk reminded me of my walks to high school. Unlike the dorms, the apartment did not feel like a prison. The fact that my friends were less then a few feet away from my room was very comforting. During some nights, I would walk to my roommates Andrew's room and watch him dominate in a game of Fortnite. <br> The worst part about living off campus was cooking. I like to eat healthy, so the food that I cooked was extremely bland. On Sunday nights, I would go grocery shopping and buy a weeks worth of groceries. Then, I would cook all the protein and vegetables that I bought, so that I would not have to worry about cooking a fresh meal every day. This saved me a lot of time, as I would only spend two hours cooking and have a weeks worth of meal. <br> When finals week was nearing, I would stop cooking completely. I would live off of frozen food, like hotpockets, or eat cereal and bagels. If I get tired of eating all that, I would just go out and grab take out. I have to admit, the dining halls were very clutch. I did not have to stress about what to eat or going hungry. <br> Living off of campus definitely changed my persepective of Riverside. I had much more freedom to do what I wanted without having my parents or resident advisors tell me what not to do. The experience of living in a dorm varies per person. For me, dorm life felt like a prison. I am always on campus and there would be nothing to do. Therefore, wait until you live off campus. I guranteed that it will be much more fun. <br> </p>

	<h1> Story3 - How To Transfer </h1>
	<p> One of the goals that I set for myself, during the first two years of college, was to transfer to another school. Without of much resources, I really had to do the research myself. It is a headache, but it is not as bad now that I look back at it. <br> If you simply google, [school name] transfer requirements, the first page should link you to what you are trying to find. Each school will either have the information easyily accessible  or you will just need to dig a little bit deeper. I suggest going on UC Irvine's website to find the requirements, because most UCs have the same requirements.<br> Once you have the information, compare your course plan with the list of requirements from the other school. You need to take every course the college requires. Therefore, you need to plan very carefully each quarter, so that you meet the requirements. Try and finish all your general education requirements along with all your lower division requirements, as UCs have something called UC Reciprocity. If you completed all your generatal education requirements, you do not need to take any at your new college. It comes in handy, in terms of saving time.<br> If you are unsure about whether or not the class you are going taking covers one of the requiremnts, you should go to <a href=http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome.html target="_blank">assist.org</a> or email the other school's counselor. <br> Now that you have all the necessary information, the final step is to keep your grades up. Try not to fail any courses, and keep your GPA above a 3.5 preferably. When I transferred I had a 3.82. <br> Do not be discouraged if you still do not get into anywhere. When college acceptance came out, I only got into 1 out of the 4 schools that I applied for. Transferring from UCs to UCs is not impossible like some people would say, but it is quite difficult. It is all luck in my opinion. Just keep working hard academically and socially. Good luck everyone! I believe in you all. </p>
