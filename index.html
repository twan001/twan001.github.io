			<p> I hope that you guys will take the time to read each story. I laid out my stories in chronological order (freshman year to present year). Read my stories, see how I approached my problems, and what I learned from it. People say that the best lessons in life are the ones you learn from your own mistakes, but I do not see a problem with learning from someone else's. High school did not prepare us for college, so I am going to take the initiative to do so. I will update this website, make it better than before, once I learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Thank you for visiting. </p>
