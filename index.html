			<p> I hope that you guys will take the time to read each story. I told the story in the form of a timeline. Read my stories, see how I approached my problems, and learn from it. People say the best lessons in life are the ones you learn from your own mistake, but I do not see a problem with learning from other's mistake. High school did not prepare us for college, so I am going to take the initiative to do so. I will update this website, make it better than before, once I have learned more HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  </p>
