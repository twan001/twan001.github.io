			<h1> About Me </h1>
			<p> Hi, my name is Thomas Wan and I am the creator of UStory. <br>
			 The purpose of this website is not only to allow me to practice web-development skills,<br> but also to educate incoming students to any university. I do not want freshman students to go into college clueless about how to adapt to the new environment. I want my viewers of my website to learn from mistakes and experiences, before going into college.<br>
			 I want  the viewers of my website to learn from the mistakes <br>that I have made as a freshman in college and make the most out of their experience.</p> <br>
